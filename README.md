## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- [Predict Housing Price](https://github.com/REDFLAG-bugs/Predict-Housing-Price): This project aims to predict housing prices using a machine learning model based on the Boston Housing Dataset. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The primary objective is to develop an accurate and interpretable model.
